## Introduction
This app was built to control the differents *annexes* we have in a contact center, improving their **search**, **control** and **management**.
To understand how Shiny works in general, you have to understand the concept of a different paradigm, **reactive programming**.

> Reactive programming is a subset of asynchronous programming and a paradigm where the availability of new information drives the logic forward rather than having control flow driven by a thread-of-execution.
>- Jonas Bon√©r and Viktor Klang, [Reactive Programming vs. Reactive Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/reactive-programming-vs-reactive-systems)

The reactivity and data flow of this repository is showed in this simple map:

This is an example of how the Shiny app looks like in the end:
